iOS7Calculator
==============

iOS 7 Calculator is a simple android application that I built back in August 2013. After becoming fascinated with how pretty the iOS 7 Calculator looked like, In decided to try and make its Android equivalent for the learning purposes. I tried my best given my limited skills at the time. I came back and reviewed it in 2014 and added few improvements.

Afterwards, I made a decision to make to release the application under the GPL Open Source Licence for the young Android developers who can benefit something from it.

This calculator is not complete and has bugs, and I have moved on to other projects so if any of the newcnewcomers feels the need to fix it, please do so and contact me and i will update the changes ASAP.

The licence is available on this repository please make sure to read and understand it.
